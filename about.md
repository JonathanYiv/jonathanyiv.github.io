# About Me

___

Hey there!

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

In 2013, I left home after graduating high school and started life independently.

I biked miles to my first job for minimum wage to support myself.

After two years of hard work, I was managing my own store, and had built a great team of people that I relied on.

The next big step in life for me is to become a software engineer.

I am passionate about building beautiful websites, managing big data, developing complex and concise business logic, using multiple languages, being a part of different workflows, seeing different creative solutions implemented for challenging problems, and making a difference.

I would like to be on the bleeding edge of technology one day.

I promise you won't be disappointed if you hire me.
