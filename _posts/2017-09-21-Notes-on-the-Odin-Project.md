**Warning:** This is a Work-in-Progress!

**Disclaimer:** I am a student of The Odin Project and as such, I ardently support it.

This post was inspired by the commonly referenced and second top result for googling 'The Odin Project,' [Everyday Utilitarian's Notes on the Odin Project](http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/notes-on-the-odin-project/).

There are a few reasons for a new post:

1. The Odin Project was created in 2013; that post was written in 2014. It is now 2017; it's outdated. Odin is an [open source project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject) meaning the curriculum, structure, projects, and resources are all subject to change.

2. The author suffers from the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge), wherein he already has 700 hours of self-study __and__ a programming job; therefore, his timeframes for completing lessons are inaccurate and personal to him since he has been exposed to a large amount of the concepts beforehand. Similarly, his recommendations on completing lessons out of order or skipping lessons entirely are in the context of him perhaps already knowing the content.

3. The author didn't strongly advocate paying it forward. If Odin is lacking in some respect, you can always contribute later when you have more knowledge __or__ add additional resources that helped you grasp the material.

It's time for a new look at Odin.

## Structure

Here's how this post is structured:

1. I will give you my frame of reference.

2. Odin is open source and why you should contribute.

3. Step-by-step walkthrough the curriculum, with commentary.

4. Impact of Odin.

5. How long will everything take?

## Perspective

I started Odin without any prior experience, aside from a high school class on Java.

I started with __zero__ hours of self-study.

This references The Odin Project during the timeframe of July 7th, 2017 to [September 21st, 2017].

Your experience with Odin will vary because your perspective going into it will probably be different. 

If you have prior coding experience, you will be able to skip sections you are familiar with and move through the curriculum more quickly.

If your only computing experience only involved checking Facebook and googling, you may have to delve into the additional resources and will move through the curriculum more slowly.

## Contributing

One of the strongest points of Odin is that it realizes that it can't hold all the best learning resources in its own hands.

There will always be a different way to learn for different people provided by different sources.

This strength exists if and only if you pay it forward by fleshing out the material.

### Beginners

You will not know how to contribute until a third of the way into Web Development 101. [[Tutorial]](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/contributing.md)

You probably don't feel knowledgeable yet, but there are some situations where you should contribute:

1. If a concept didn't make sense to you, the provided resources/additional resources didn't help, and you found another resource that made everything click -- add it in.

2. Typo? Fix it.

3. Broken Link? See if you can find a recent version in the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to update the link, and if not, remove it.

### Intermediate to Advanced

About halfway through Rails, you will find you are able to contribute at a more advanced level. This is great to develop experience working in a team workflow and encountering novel problems.

Check out the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/wiki/Contributing-Guide) for full details.

Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/issues) that need help.

Check out what [Projects](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/projects) are being worked on.

## The Curriculum

Follow these simple rules.

If you understand it, move forward.

If you don't understand it, delve into the additional resources.

If you want a stronger understanding, be wary of [rabbit holes](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Rabbit%20Hole) and delve deeper.

Be careful that you don't use rabbit holes or wanting perfect understanding as a means of procrastination.

### Introduction to Web Development

This course is on the chopping block of the curators. 

If you have come to Odin with the intention to learn web development, go ahead and skip to Web Development 101.

If you don't know if web development is for you, peruse through this section lightly to get a good grasp.
