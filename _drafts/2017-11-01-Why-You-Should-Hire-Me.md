Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

**Reasons why you should Hire Me.**

Let's shake it up, though, and address the concerns you probably have!

1. You don't have a college degree! You aren't even in school!
2. You don't have any programming work experience.
3. You aren't skilled enough.
4. "Developers" who learn from online curriculum are usually shallow and not well-rounded in their knowledge.
5. You would not provide any benefits to our team as you are.

## Concern 1: You don't have a college degree! You aren't even in school!

The typical response to this would be "Look at ____ who dropped out of school and is now a **billionaire!**" and then they would link you to an infographic like [this](https://blog.adioma.com/entrepreneurs-who-dropped-out-infographic/) or something.

I'm not here to say that. I'm not special or going to be some magical hero that conquers the world and makes billions of dollars.

I'm not saying that college is useless or doesn't work. It definitely has a lot of value and imparts a lot of valuable knowledge for every generation of students.

What I will say is that I am extremely hard-working, diligent, and smart.

I will also say that the barrier to entry of web development is lower than becoming something like a doctor, and that the online resources providing the technical knowledge to develop oneself are plentiful.

For a while now, everyday: I code, read, code, read, code, read, eat, do my household tasks, and sleep.

I follow an open source curriculum called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) which has nice little checkboxes at the end of each lesson, curates resources from a wide variety of sites and authors, made by someone and many who are smarter and further along than me.

I believe, with time and substantial effort, anyone can learn the same skills that they teach you in college.

My effort is not any more or less valuable than a driven college student's. I'd argue it is equivalent.

Please consider me with an open mind even though my life circumstances didn't lead me on the same path as others.


## Concern 2: You don't have any programming work experience.

That is true; I don't.

I do, however, work on my local machine and have developed a variety of projects [(See GitHub)](https://github.com/JonathanYiv) that -- while not overly complex -- demonstrate that I am capable to a certain degree.

I also have a long work history (at least for my short 22 year old life) where I climbed up from the bottom rung of a career and proved myself as competent in positions where I did not receive very much training.

I have always grown, not faltered, when tested by a "trial of fire."

In my last job, my first week running a store alone was hectic, full of trial and error, and many frustrating situations.

My third week running my newly acquired store was the busiest week on record, and my boss three levels up was on the ground helping me get things straight. I worked 95 hours that week and I got through it.

I can not understate that these weeks were incredibly hard for me to overcome and learn from.

So.. while I don't have programming work experience.. I hope you can overlook that, based on my track record of always stepping up to the plate and growing to meet the demands.


## Concern 3: You aren't skilled enough.

Technically, yes to an extent.

There are gaps in my knowledge that will be filled with time.

Let me show you how I visualize it.

From my readings about self-taught people who switched careers into programming, the average time taken to have gotten hired is about 9 months.

They usually work their day job, then spend about a part-time job's worth of time studying.

In my case, I dedicated myself to studying full-time, which should mean that it should take about half the time.

However, I am only about three months in from the supposed four and a half month mark that would traditionally get me hired (based on this prediction model..), so here is where I stand:

![Current Progress Graph](/assets/images/current_progress_graph.png)

So while I'm not there.. I am incredibly close to reaching that mark.

In fact, as mentioned earlier, I do particularly well when I have the pressure of having to learn rapidly.

So if you were to hire me right now..

I believe I would quickly bring myself up to speed, because it is very important to me that I contribute in a positive manner.

I am very close to having the necessary skill. 

See my next two responses for why it is worth it for you to invest in me.

## Concern 4: "Developers" who learn from online curriculum are usually shallow and not well-rounded in their knowledge.

## Concern 5: You would not provide any benefit to our team as you are.
