# About Me

___

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

In 2013 I left home after graduating high school and started to live independently.

I biked miles to my first job for minimum wage to support myself.

After two years of hard work and promotions, I was given my own worn-down Domino's store.

For the next two years, that store was my baby. I built up a great team of reliable people, a network of manager colleagues, trained employees from the ground up to their own store, and broke store records.

I learned about opportunities for promotion, but realized that this isn't what I want to do. I spent time reflecting and discovered a passion for coding.

I am passionate about building beautiful websites, managing big data, developing complex yet concise business logic, incorporating multiple languages, workflows, implementing creative solutions for challenging problems, and making a difference.

I want to be a software engineer.

I will work hard. I will learn whatever I need to learn. I will whatever roles I need to fill.

I will be the guy that gets it done.

...

When I'm not coding, you can find me progressing in my current videogame or manipulating my way to victory in a boardgame.
