# About Me

___

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

In 2013 I left home after graduating high school and started to live independently.
I biked miles to my first job for minimum wage to support myself.
After two years of hard work and promotions, I was given my own worn down Domino's store to manage.

For the next two years, that store was my baby. I poured my heart and soul into making it outstanding. I built up a great team of reliable people, a network of manager colleagues, trained employees from the ground up until they could obtain their own stores, received awards, and broke store records.

I learned about opportunities for promotion, but realized that this isn't what I want to do. I spent time reflecting, and discovered a passion for coding.
I am passionate about building beautiful websites, managing big data, developing complex yet concise business logic, incorporating multiple languages, workflows, implementing creative solutions for challenging problems, and making a difference.

I want to be a software engineer.

I will strive to be a valuable asset to your company, both as an independent worker, and as a team player.

I will demonstrate determination and grit when it comes to learning new skills needed for the job. 

I will make great effort to go above and beyond while fulfilling all tasks given to me.

I am the guy that gets it done.

When I'm not coding, you can find me progressing in my current videogame or manipulating my way to victory in a boardgame.
