# About Me

___

Hey there!

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

In 2013, I ran away from home after graduating high school and started life anew.

To support myself, I biked miles to my first job for minimum wage, but always strived to do better and climb higher.

After two years of hard work, I had climbed several steps of the ladder to managing a multimillion dollar business with great success.

I have a dream of climbing even higher and to be my own boss one day.

The next big step in my plan is to become a software engineer.

I want to build beautiful websites, manage big data, develop complex but concise business logic in the backend, learn multiple languages, experience the workflows of large and small teams, see different creative solutions implemented for challenging problems, and make a difference.

You can be a part of my journey by hiring me.

I promise I won't disappoint.
