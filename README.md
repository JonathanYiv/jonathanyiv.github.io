# Personal Resume/Portfolio/Blogging Website

Hello!

This is the source code for my [personal resume/portfolio/blogging website](https://jonathanyiv.github.io/).

![Screenshot]("/assets/images/screenshot.png")

It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

I'm experimenting with the [Issues](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/jonathanyiv.github.io/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/jonathanyiv.github.io/projects) functions of GitHub to slightly mimic a possible real-life workflow.

I expect this to undergo many iterations as my skills grow.

If you have any feedback, feel free to leave an issue or shoot me an email at JonathanYiv@gmail.com.
