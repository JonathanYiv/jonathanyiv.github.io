# About Me

___

Hey there!

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

In 2013 I left home after graduating high school and started to live independently.

I biked miles to my first job for minimum wage to support myself.

After two years of hard work, I was managing my own store and had built a great team of people that I relied on.

My next big step in life is to become a software engineer.

I am passionate about building beautiful websites, managing big data, developing complex yet concise business logic, incorporating multiple languages, workflows, implementing creative solutions for challenging problems, and making a difference.

I promise you won't be disappointed if you hire me.

...

On evenings, you'll find me cooped up playing videogames.

I really want Super Mario Odyssey and Stardew Valley right now, but I'm waiting until Black Friday to get the Nintendo Switch.

Next year, Monster Hunter World is coming out...
