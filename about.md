# About Me

___

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

In 2013 I left home after graduating high school and started to live independently.

I biked miles to my first job for minimum wage to support myself.

After two years of hard work, I was managing my own Domino's store and had built a great team of people that I relied on.

For the next two years, I built up a network of manager colleagues, trained employees from the ground up to their own store, and broke store records.

My next big step in life is to become a software engineer.

I am passionate about building beautiful websites, managing big data, developing complex yet concise business logic, incorporating multiple languages, workflows, implementing creative solutions for challenging problems, and making a difference.

I promise you won't be disappointed if you hire me.

I have a track record of data-driven decisions, success, and working with a large team. 
These skills will translate directly toward building an excellent product and having strong communication with you and our team.

When I'm not coding, you can find me progressing in my current videogame or manipulating my way to victory in a boardgame.
