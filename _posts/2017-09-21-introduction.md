Hello there!

My name is Jonathan Yiv.

On July 7th, 2017, I began my journey of learning how to program through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

So far, I've made it about halfway.

Besides the projects which are interspersed throughout the curriculum, I do a fair amount of learning behind the scenes.

This blog is a testament to that and will serve as documentation for what I am currently working on.


There will be three core principles that I will adhere to going forward:

* Write like you are teaching yourself a new concept.

* Write to the point.

* Write using simple terms.

My goal is to write accessible, informative, and useful posts that can be used as reference by future me or someone learning.

Nice to meet you.
