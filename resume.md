## General Manager - Domino's

<sub>Oct 2015 - Mar 2017</sub>

My store was a Top 300 Domino's store (out of ~13,000 at the time) with ~2 Million in yearly sales and several awards for sales/service/operations.

I've been asked to speak at regional meetings.

Five of my former Assistant Managers have become General Managers.


## Head Assistant Manager - Domino's

<sub>Jul 2014 - Oct 2015</sub>

Responsible for day-to-day operations

* Running shifts, cross-training staff, maintaining food/labor costs, performing customer service, and maintaining standards.

During my tenure as head assistant manager, this store experienced massive sales growth and performance optimizations.


## Delivery Driver - Domino's

<sub>Mar 2014 - Jul 2014</sub>

Ensured deliveries were packaged correctly, delivered quickly through usage of shortcuts or low traffic areas while adhering to traffics laws, and was friendly at the door.

I would often take two deliveries while my coworkers took one.


## Flow Team Member - Target

<sub>Mar 2014 - Jul 2014</sub>

Unloaded the truck and processed packages on a rapidly moving assembly line towards their correct palettes.

Properly stacked boxes on the palettes to achieve maximum height.

Delivered palettes to appropriate store locations and filled shelves quickly and efficiently.

There was a hierarchy where the newbies were on the assembly line and the best were inside unloading the truck. 

I quickly worked my way up to being inside the truck and even floating to the assembly line to speed things along.


## Cart Attendant - Target

<sub> Sep 2013 - Mar 2014</sub>

Ferried carts from cart racks into the store regularly to ensure the store was stocked and the cart racks did not overflow.

Ensured shopping baskets were spread throughout the store and that the cashier bins were emptied out and processed accordingly.

Floated to help cashiers, guest service, and food service.

On Black Friday, there was an overnight shift I took for fun.

Getting carts was incredibly difficult because it was dark and there were only one or two carts outside at any given time, meaning I was jogging from the lot to the store.

Customers waited in a line for carts, and every cart that hit the parking lot was brought in within minutes.
