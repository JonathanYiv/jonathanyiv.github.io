This is an implementation of Facebook in Rails without the AJAX and Chat features.

It models the associations necessary to have users, posts, comments, likes, friends, and friend requests.
It is deployed on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database, styled with Materialize CSS, has authentication with Devise/Omniauth-Facebook, enables image uploading directly to an Amazon S3 Bucket with Shrine, seeded the database using Faker, and has full test coverage of models/controllers with FactoryBot and MiniTest.
